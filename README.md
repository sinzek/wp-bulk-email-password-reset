# wp-bulk-email-password-reset
Lightweight wordpress plugin that allows mass sending of password reset emails as background processes with real-time logging through AJAX

**Works best when used with an SMTP server to ensure deliverability**

I refuse to add this to the marketplace so here it is on github :>
